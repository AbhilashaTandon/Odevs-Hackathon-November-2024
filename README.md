# Florida Storm Risk Data

## Overview

This is a datatool created to assess the security of housing installations in Florida against flood risks due to hurricanes. It combines [storm surge data](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/nationalsurge/#data) from NOAA and housing data, focusing on housing that is old or with lower value as more critical.
